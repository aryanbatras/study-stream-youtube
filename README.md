## About Project

Build a platform for students who can see other students live that are fetched from some keywords like study with me videos that are live. And then a student can visit our platform, put himself live on YouTube, pin other live YouTube channels and study, just like a replica of study stream but completely free of cost.


🌙 “StudyFlow” — A calm digital library powered by YouTube Live
Imagine opening a website that feels like a quiet night café for students.
Soft colors. No noise. No clutter. Just people learning together.

🌟 Core Idea
A place where students:
Go live on YouTube
Join a global focus space
Pin other students’ streams
Sit together silently
And feel motivated just by knowing “someone else is studying with me too.”
The platform doesn’t judge. Doesn’t push. It just holds space.

💡 UI Inspiration
Think of a design like this:

🎴 1. Minimal card grid of live students
Each card:
A YouTube live thumbnail (auto-updating)
A tiny username
A “Join Quietly” mini button
A calm glow around the card when it’s live
Something like:
+---------------------------------+
| [YouTube stream preview iframe] |
|---------------------------------|
|  • Aryan is studying CS         |
|  Join quietly →                 |
+---------------------------------+
Warm. Cozy. Simple.

🧘 2. Your own live study booth
When a user starts their stream, show a personal booth:
Timer
Ambient mode
Task list
“Daily consistency streak”
A soft background gradient
Think:
A warm desk lamp feeling on a website.

🌍 3. Rooms
Rooms like:
Deep Focus
Competitive Study
Chill Coding
Night Owls
Pomodoro Room
“Just be here” Room
Each room simply filters different streams.
No fancy features. Just calm spaces.

🌬️ 4. Pin Your Study Buddies
Student can pin 2–4 YouTube live streams on the side:
| main screen (your live or someone else's) |
|--------------------------------------------|
| pinned streams on the right               |
Feels like sitting next to friends in a library.

🌱 5. Very quiet UX
Everything is:
Rounded
Soft
Subtle
Low-contrast
Relaxing
No bright reds, no confusion — very calming.
